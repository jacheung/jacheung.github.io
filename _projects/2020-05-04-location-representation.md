#### Primer
If you havenâ€™t had a chance yet, read this short [primer](http://jacheung.com/blog/neuroscience-primer) on how neuroscientists study touch and this previous project about [touch behaviors](http://jacheung.com/project/localization-behavior) I worked on. Both will help frame why we set off on the journey into the brain.
