I hold fast to what the director of the National Institute of Health, Francis Collins, shared to us young researchers before we set off for graduate school: 
> "A doctoral degree is a degree in critical thinking. It is not a degree limited to the field you are studying. Take steps to cultivate an environment and rhythms where you'll love learning and grow in your craft."  
-Francis Collins

On April 20th, 2020 I successfully defended my thesis, “The Behavioral and Neural Bases of Tactile Object Localization”. As I look back, I feel lucky and grateful to have had a wonderfully productive Ph.D. experience. I believe that the [Hires laboratory](https://www.hireslab.org/), established in 2014 and though young, is in the top 95th percentile of neuroscience labs because of the brilliant minds that are in it, the questions we're answering, the tools we're using, and the discoveries we have made. During my time from 2015 to 2020, I have authorship in 4 high-impact research articles. As I look back, I attribute this productivity to the environment I was placed in and cultivating healthy rhythms early. Below are established rhythms and cultivated environment that I believe made my doctoral journey so successful.

#### **Organize and deliver**:

I believe this is the key component to solving innovative problems quickly and growing. To those in software development, methods for organization are defined as agile methodologies and frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban. These frameworks highlight clear and actionable goals with daily, weekly, and monthly milestones. With clear milestones operating on short timescales adopters of this principle, whether they be individuals or in teams, adapt and grow quickly. 

As a doctoral student and those in industry that are innovating, the problems you are solving has probably never been tackled before and the steps to reach your goal are likely nebulous. With clear project goals but nebulous steps, frameworks for planning and flexibly improving become ever so important. For myself, I spend the first Sunday of each month planning out goals for each week and every Sunday planning out goals for the daily. Planning involves writing down goals sorted by order of importance with daily, weekly, and monthly deadlines. Set goals that are both practical to reach and also a bit further than you could’ve imagined yourself reaching for. The process of writing down goals mentally prepares your mind so that going to work doesn’t come as a shock. Organize and deliver and you'll go from treading water to swimming with the current. 

#### **Drafting a team**:

My doctorate taught me that the best teams aren’t full of similar individuals. Yes we all know this saying but where that difference should lie was something I had to learn. Hire too diverse a set of individuals and collaboration will be difficult. Hire too similar of individuals and there’ll be no creativity.  

As the first hire, I had a say in choosing who would join our team. I selected individuals who had the same disciplines in organization, as I believed this was the defining trait that made a doctorate successful. However, my manager vetoed many of my decision to pass on individuals and I thought he was dead wrong. After years of working with my team I saw how we devised creative solutions, inspired growth amongst one another, and made fascinating discoveries. We would each spend hours working on our problems and at the end of the day or the week we’d stay after hours, crack open a can of beer, and talk science over great food. These conversations forced each person to clearly communicate their ideas in front of peers that were highly inquisitive and had different ways of thinking. Ideas were refined after each shared meal and we all grew to love having our ideas challenged.  

Looking back I saw that I was thinking too small in what defined a great scientist and what to look for when drafting a successful team. What I look for may broaden in the future but I’ve learned to embrace individuals who are inquisitive and will chase problems down. I believe a team of individuals who embody this simple truth will bring success to any company and mission.

#### **Learning humility**

As years passed and many conversations were shared over meals and hallway passings, I saw how my thought process was being refined. 

The biggest challenge I had to overcome was learning humility in order to receiving criticism well. Solving complex problems required not just grit but the forging fire of individuals who were unafraid to question your every step. I was humbled by the process of angrily defending what I felt were fully fleshed out ideas but still having my team continually pour great ideas onto me. The click happened when I recognized their questioning came from a place of curiosity and not malice or a flex. Standing my tallest and seeing loving teammates pour great ideas onto me was a truly humbling experience. 

> "The true way to be humble is not to stoop until you are smaller than yourself, but to stand at your real height against some higher nature that will show you what the real smallness of your greatness is."  
-Phillips Brooks.

As an example, when it came to building a predictive behavioral modeling for my first major research project the difficulty came in creative feature engineering and model interpretation. It wasn’t good enough to build a model that predicted well but one that we could understand and press that boundary of what we knew about the brain and behavior. Defining which features were most important and which machine learning tool was best fit required pooling knowledge, experience, and intuition from the team. Eight months of frustrating conversations resulted in a refined model where we, as a team, knew the ins and outs of each intricate component and our first major publication in Cell Press.  

As taxing as that was, I wouldn’t trade those moments and conversations for anything. Today, iterating ideas and making discoveries with the team is a much quicker process. Laying my pride down (though it’s still hard to do) lets me receive feedback and grow ideas. Without them for me and me for them, our team would not have been as productive as it is. I love the people I work with and my thought process as a scientist would not be what it is without them.
