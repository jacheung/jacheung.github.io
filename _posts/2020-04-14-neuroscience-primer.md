The brain and behavior are inextricably linked; rodents serve as powerful models to study this.

#### The brain and behavior.

The brain and behavior are inextricably linked and rodents serve as powerful models to study this. To understand the fundamentals of how the brain represents the outside world, we must first define a behavior, measure the brain during behavior, and finally manipulate the brain to observe how behavior changes. Compared to humans and non-human primates, mice are unmatched in the diversity and sophistication of tools available to label, record, and finely assess the brain across a range of rich behaviors. They stand as model systems to study the brain and how it drives perception. 


#### Well, where do we begin? Let’s start by choosing a sensory system.

As you all may know, there are five senses: vision, audition, touch, olfaction, and taste. Each sensory system, using mice as models, has unique advantages and disadvantages for studying the brain. 

First, _**vision**_ is the most valued sense and much is known about its computation in the periphery and the brain. There are numerous research articles about the computation of vision; there are applications of this work in machine image recognition, self-driving cars, and object detection just to name a few. But, there are disadvantages too as mice don't depend on their visual system and their visual cortex is not as developed as other mammals. 

Second, _**audition**_ provides researchers precise stimuli control unmatched in any other sense. However, accessibility to the cortex is terribly difficult. Both of these senses, vision and audition, also have advantages in complex computations. Complexity provides a framework to understand how biology has solved a problem that we have yet to figure out. For example, in vision there is the computation of depth perception and object recognition amidst occlusion and in audition source separation, filtering, and the cocktail party effect. Understanding how the brain performs these computations effortlessly may lend insight into how we can build machines that can do the same. 

Third, studying _**touch**_, via mouse whiskers, is advantageous because it is behaviorally relevant (i.e. rodents depend on whiskers for touch similar to how humans use their fingertips), touch features can be simply measured and computed, and the touch cortex (i.e. somatosensory cortex) is well-mapped and easily accessible. Disadvantages currently involve tracking all whiskers in 3-dimensions and control in stimulus sampling (i.e. we can’t choose where and how mice whisk). 

With the above three senses, researchers have studied perception by looking at the sensory representation in the cortex. Cortex is what many believe gives humans our intellectual and perceptual abilities, but the circuitry of cortex is complex and much effort is being invested in deciphering the computations performed at each node along the circuit. Compared to the other senses studying _**olfaction**_ in rodents is advantageous because the olfactory bulb performs similar computations as the cortex but its circuitry is simpler. Similar to touch, studying olfaction is ethologically relevant and the region responsible for olfaction perception (i.e. olfactory bulb) is easily accessible for brain recordings.

Lastly for those with molecular backgrounds, the stimulus of _**taste**_ can be simply probed via measurements of specific channels that transduce sweet, umami, sour, salt, spicy and bitter flavors from the periphery (i.e. tongue). However since taste is the least studied sensory system, research is currently focused on the periphery (i.e. tongue) and not the cortex.

For questions understanding how the brain and behavior are inextricably linked, touch as a sensory system is perfect. This model system would provide an avenue to precisely monitor behavior, easily record brain activity in the cortex, and manipulate the brain to see how touch perception is altered.

#### Tell me a bit more about touch. 

 The sense of touch is ubiquitous in everything we do but is generally overlooked. It encapsulates sensations of vibration, pressure, pain, temperature and muscle movements, all of which are essential to many unnoticed actions such as fishing through your pockets for coins or reaching for a cup of coffee. Despite its broad importance, our knowledge of how the brain computes a perception of touch is still in its infancy. Specifically, localization by touch and how it’s represented by the brain is unknown. Recognizing the location of objects through touch is crucial for manipulating the objects around us, avoiding environmental dangers, and building an internal map of the external world when vision is not present.

#### Why are mice so great for studying touch?

Questions regarding brain representations of touch are poised for studies using the rodent whisker system. This system offers both ethological and technological advantages. Behaviorally, rodents depend on touch from their whiskers, similar to how humans use their fingers, as a primary sense to explore and navigate the space around them. Anatomically, this system is organized with a 1:1 mapping where columns of neurons in the somatosensory cortex are primarily dedicated to processing information for a single whisker (See the below figure). Researchers have also developed and are still pushing the boundaries of tools used to observe the brain. There are numerous genetic mouse lines and advanced observation tools (e.g. two photon calcium imaging and multi-unit electrophysiology recordings) to label specific neurons and record brain activity at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The combination of ethology and advanced tool design make rodents powerful models to assess cortical activity during active touch behaviors.
