#### The brain and behavior

The brain and behavior are inextricably linked and rodents serve as powerful models to study this. To understand the fundamentals of how the brain represents the outside world, we must first define a behavior, measure the brain during behavior, and finally manipulate the brain to observe how behavior changes. Compared to humans and non-human primates, mice are unmatched in the diversity and sophistication of tools available to label, record, and finely assess the brain across a range of rich behaviors. They stand as model systems to study the brain and how it drives perception. 


#### Well, where do we begin? Let’s start by choosing a sensory system

As you all may know, there are five senses: vision, audition, touch, olfaction, and taste. Each sensory system, using mice as models, has unique advantages and disadvantages which I will briefly go over. First, vision is the most valued sense and much is known about its computation in the periphery and the brain. There are numerous research articles about the computation of **vision**; applications in machine image recognition, self-driving cars, object detection, and much more. In vision there are disadvantages with hard to design stimuli and difficult stimulus control (e.g. gaze control). Second, **audition** provides researchers precise stimuli control unmatched in any other sense. However, accessibility to the cortex is terribly difficult  Both of these senses, vision and audition, also have advantages in complex computations. Complexity is advantageous because it provides a framework to understand how biology has solved a problem that we have yet to figure out. For example, in vision there is the computation of depth perception and object recognition amidst occlusion and in audition source separation, filtering, and the cocktail party effect. Third, studying **touch**, via mouse whiskers, is advantageous because it is behaviorally relevant (i.e. rodents depend on whiskers for touch similar to how humans use their fingertips), touch features can be simply measured and computed, and the touch cortex (i.e. somatosensory cortex) is well-mapped and easily accessible. Disadvantages currently involve tracking all whiskers in 3-dimensions and control in stimulus sampling (i.e. we can’t choose where and how mice whisk). With the above three senses, researchers have studied perception by looking at the sensory representation in the cortex. Cortex is what many believe gives us our intellectual and perceptual abilities, but the circuitry of cortex is complex and much effort is being invested in deciphering the computations performed at each node along the circuit. Compared to the other senses studying **olfaction** in rodents is advantageous because the olfactory bulb performs similar computations as the cortex but is simpler. Similar to touch, studying olfaction is great for simple behaviors (e.g. mix odors, deliver, and probe choice) that mice can learn quickly, the brain region for olfaction (i.e. olfactory bulb) is easily accessible for brain recordings, but controlling sampling (i.e. sniff cycles) is difficult.. Lastly for those with molecular backgrounds, the stimulus of **taste** can be simply probed via measurements of specific channels that transduce sweet, umami, sour, salt, spicy and bitter flavors from the periphery (i.e. tongue). For questions understanding how the brain and behavior are inextricably linked, touch as a sensory system is perfect. This model system would provide an avenue to precisely monitor behavior, easily record brain activity in the cortex, and manipulate the brain to see how touch and perception is altered.

#### Tell me a bit more about touch. 

 The sense of touch is ubiquitous in everything we do but is generally overlooked. It encapsulates sensations of vibration, pressure, pain, temperature and muscle movements, all of which are essential to many unnoticed actions such as fishing through your pockets for coins or reaching for a cup of coffee. Despite its broad importance, our knowledge of how the brain computes a perception of touch is still in its infancy. Specifically, localization by touch and how it’s represented by the brain is unknown. Recognizing the location of objects through touch is crucial for manipulating the objects around us, avoiding environmental dangers, and building an internal map of the external world when vision is not present.

#### Why are mice so great for studying touch?

But there are so many ways to observe touch! What’s the best way to study touch behaviors and the brain? Questions regarding brain representations of touch are poised for studies using the rodent whisker system. This system offers both ethological and technological advantages. Behaviorally, rodents depend on touch from their whiskers, similar to how humans use their fingers, as a primary sense to explore and navigate the space around them (Vincent 1912). Anatomically, this system is organized with a 1:1 mapping where columns of neurons in S1 are primarily dedicated to processing information for a single whisker (i.e. principal whisker) (Woolsey and Van der Loos 1970). The combination of behavior and anatomical organization provides a convenient way to assess cortical activity in vivo during active whisker behaviors (O’Connor et al., 2010). Technologically, scientists have developed genetic and advanced tools to label specific neuronal populations and probe the brain.
