title: About me
subtitle: Data Scientist | Ph.D. Neuroscience
---

I am an organized and self-motivated data scientist with a desire to interpret data and supplement human insight. This is evidenced by 6 years of experience using machine learning tools for data-driven scientific discovery leading to 5 scientific publications in Neuroscience.

The successes of my academic career provided me with the skillsets necessary for envisioning and crafting ETLs from data sources to warehouse and finally to machine learning models. These skillsets secured two data science contracts where I was responsible for building pipelines for data collection, efficient analyses, machine learning models, and fast dynamic visualizations. The fruit of these labors have resulted in cost-savings to the companies and increased value to customers.
