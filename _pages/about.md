Check out my [Resume](https://jacheung.github.io/images/documents/Resume-200522.pdf) and [CV](https://jacheung.github.io/images/documents/CV-200522.pdf).

I spend a lot of time thinking about solving problems with data and building AI we can trust. 

I grew up in San Francisco and fell in love with neuroscience after watching my dad navigate the city effortlessly. I was always amazed at how the brain transformed the outside world into an internal map. This fascination brought me to a degree in computational biology at UC San Diego and afterwards a presitigious research residency at the NIH studying the brain's memory center, the hippocampus. After a productive research experience, I completed a PhD in computational neuroscience studying how the cortex builds internal maps using touch. My successes at USC launched me to where I am now: a data scientist with a desire to transform society using innovative and interpretable AI we can trust.

When I'm not reading the latest in interpretable AI tools I'm braising short ribs, dry aging steaks, or tossing some food on the grill while chatting with friends and throwing back a beer.
