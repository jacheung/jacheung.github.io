###I spend a lot of time thinking about solving problems with data and learning about how we can build machines and systems we can trust. 

###I grew up in San Francisco and fell in love with neuroscience after watching my dad navigate the city effortlessly. I was always amazed at how the brain transformed the outside world into an internal map. This fascination brought me to a degree in computational biology degree at UC San Diego and a presitigious research residency at the NIH studying the brain's memory center, the hippocampus. After a productive research experience at the NIH, I completed a PhD in computational neuroscience studying how the touch is used to build maps. My successes at USC launched me to where I am now: a data scientist with a desire to transform society using innovative and interpretable AI and we can trust.

### When I'm not reading the latest in interpretable AI tools I'm braising short ribs, dry aging steaks, or tossing some food on the grill while chatting with friends and throwing back a beer. Possibly could be doing that and doing some carpentry.
