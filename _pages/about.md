Check out my [Resume](https://jacheung.github.io/images/documents/Resume_200710.pdf) and [CV](https://jacheung.github.io/images/documents/Jonathan_Cheung_CV_210505.pdf).

I spend a lot of time thinking about solving problems with data and building AI we can trust. 

*Where I've been:* I grew up watching my dad effortless navigate the city of San Francisco and amazed at how the brain transformed the outside world into an internal map. This fascination led me to a degree in computational biology at UC San Diego, a research residency at the NIH, and afterwards a PhD in computational neuroscience at the University of Southern California in the [Hires Lab](https://www.hireslab.org/) studying how the cortex builds internal maps using touch. 

*What I've learned:* At each node of my educational track, I gained a deeper appreciation for the tools used to anchor abstract concepts (e.g. thought/perception) into quantifiable metrics. My doctorate revealed the insights machine-learning (ML) tools could provide to the study of touch perception; data science contracts during this period highlighted the value of automation and data pipelines to scale business solutions. 

*Where I'm at now:* My excitement for automation, scalability, and leveraging ML tools lead me to where I am now: a data scientist driving the transition towards clean and renewable fuels (e.g. hydrogen) at the Southern California Gas Company. 

When I'm not reading the latest in AI tools I'm braising short ribs, dry aging steaks, or tossing some food on the grill.
