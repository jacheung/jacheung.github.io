Check out my [Resume](/images/documents/JC_Resume_230105.pdf) and [CV](/images/documents/JC_CV_230105.pdf).

I spend a lot of time thinking about solving problems with data and building AI we can trust. 

**Where I've been:** I grew up watching my dad effortless navigate the city of San Francisco and amazed at how the brain created maps of the world around us. This fascination led me to a degree in computational biology at UC San Diego, a research residency at the NIH, and afterwards a PhD in systems neuroscience at the University of Southern California in the [Hires Lab](https://www.hireslab.org/) studying how the cortex builds internal maps using touch. 


**What I've learned:** At each node of my educational track, I gained a deeper appreciation for the tools used to anchor abstract concepts (e.g. thought/perception) into quantifiable metrics. My doctorate revealed the insights machine-learning tools could provide to the study of touch perception; working as a data scientist highlighted the value that automation and data pipelines brought to scaling business solutions.  


**Where I'm at now:** My excitement for automation, scalability, and building AI we can trust lead me to where I am now: a data scientist in the AI Solutions group at [Beyond Limits](https://www.beyond.ai/).  


When Iâ€™m not reading a book, you can find me braising short ribs, making pesto and pasta from scratch, or tossing some food on the grill.
